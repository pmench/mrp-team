## Intro to R 

```{r}
# install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## Mixed Effects Regression
A mixed effects model contains both **fixed effects** and **random effects.** A fixed effect is a parameter that does not vary. Random effects are parameters that are random variables. 

![mixed effects example.](mixed_effects_2.png)

```{r}
stan_glmer(vs ~ (1 | cyl) + (1 | hp) + (1 | am), data = mtcars, family = binomial(link = "logit"),
    prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 0.5, autoscale = TRUE),
    prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 0.5, autoscale = TRUE),
    seed = 853)
```


## Multinomial Logistic Regression (Discrete Choice Model)

*Logistic regression*: Models binary outcomes.
*Multinomial logistic regression*: The model to use when your outcome variable takes one of several options.
- **Example**: A consumer has the option to purchase a product from one of several brands.

### Applications
- Market share and pricing analysis (how would increasing prices affect market share?)
- New technology adoption (what factors influence the adoption of a new technology?)
- Competitive analysis (how do product/service features influence consumer preferences?)

```{r}
library(mlogit) # Note the multinom function from the nnet package does not require reshaping dataMi
library(caret)
print('hello world')

```

```{r}

```
