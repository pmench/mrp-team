                It's election season! (Is it ever not?) That means it's also election <em>prediction</em> season, where
                legions of pundits, "personalities", and pollsters opine on who will win in November, with varying levels
                of methodological integrity. And although it has a certain cachet to say that Joe Biden has the advantage
                because as a Scorpio Sun in the twelfth house he vibes better with the zeitgeist, most analyst use more,
                ahem, complex methods. But what are those methods? How do they work? How do polls turn into predictions?
                We're here to answer your questions. But first, a quick refresher on U.S. elections.

              <h3>All About U.S. Presidential Elections (In 5 Minutes or Less)</h3>
              <p>
                  Here's the weird thing about U.S. presidential elections: The people don't elect the president. One
                  would assume that candidates become president if they win the popular vote, that is if they earn a
                  majority (or plurality) of votes. Instead, when you cast a vote for a candidate, you're actually voting
                  for "electors," who are the people who <em>actually</em> cast votes for a specific candidate.  In most states,
                  the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state gets a group of electors who all cast votes for
                  that candidate (but note that electors aren't necessarily required to vote for their state's winner—in
                  2016, electors cast votes for John Kasich and Colin Powell (Fortier 2020, 9)).
              </p>

              <p>
                  The Constitution empowers state legislatures to decide how to appoint these Electors and currently all
                  states make that decision based on the popular vote, though the mechanics of it vary from state to
                  state (Fortier 2020, 3-6). Suffice to say: Citizens cast their votes for a presidential candidate,
                  which results in certain electors being appointed, who are supposed to follow the popular will in their
                  state and vote for the presidential candidate who earned the most votes in their state. Then, the
                  candidate who wins the majority of votes cast by electors wins the election.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Nationwide, there are 538 electors and each state gets a certain number of electors based on its
                  congressional representation. This leads to a much-criticized aspect of the Electoral College:
                  smaller states wield more electoral power. The size of the House and Senate are fixed so even though
                  the number of Representatives a state gets adjusts based on a state's population, and thus the number
                  of electors each state gets remains relative to its population, the number of people represented by
                  one electoral vote is much greater in populous states.

                    The map of the U.S. is first distorted relative to the number of electoral college votes each state 
                    gets (based on the 2020 Census), and then distorts relative to each state's population (2022 ACS 
                    5-Year Estimates).

              <p>
                  Confused? Imagine this: You have one pie and have to divide it among groups of people. Each group must
                  get one slice and the size of the slice should be relative to the size of the group. The larger groups
                  get larger slices and the smaller groups get smaller slices. That's only fair right? But you don't have
                  infinite pie (if only!). So even though you can keep the size of slices relative to the sizes of each
                  group, if a big groups keep getting bigger, each person in the big group is going to be getting smaller
                  mouthfuls of pie.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now think about this: how would candidates' campaign strategies, and their political agendas, change
                  if they had to win the popular vote and not the Electoral College? And what is the purpose of democracy
                  anyway? Is it supposed to enact the will of the majority? Or protect the rights of the minority? While
                  you ponder those questions, we'll turn to the mechanics of political polling and prediction.

                  PollRBear was created by Bella Karduck, Haley Johnson, Rohit Maramraju, and Philip Menchaca in partial
                  fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Information, Data Science, at
                  the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It is intended to provide an accessible introduction to methods
                  used for political polling and prediction. Graphics were generated with Python and R, and this website
                  was built with the Django and Materialize CSS frameworks.
